Welcome! We're going to be calculating you're carbon footprint holistically.

A way of calculating a persons carbon footprint is looking at how you spend your money.

The government actually has quite a large carbon footprint! Which could definitely be made more efficient.

So if you're interested in getting a glimpse at that, please enter your salary, and you can see the carbon footprint in your taxes.

//Not currently working//
Gross Wage
<<listbox "_salaryTimePeriod" autoselect>>
	<<optionsfrom $timePeriod>>
<</listbox>>
Paid
<<numberbox "$salary" 1500 autofocus>>



So you wake up for the day, and end up looking in your wardrobe to get dressed.

Your wardrobe actually has a fairly large impact on your carbon footprint.

How often do you buy new clothing?
<<set _clothesTimePeriod = $timePeriod.Monthly>>
<<listbox "_clothesTimePeriod" autoselect>>
	<<optionsfrom $timePeriod>>
<</listbox>>

How much do you spend on average when you buy new clothes? (in Â£)
<<numberbox "_clothesSpendPerPeriod" 40>> \

<<button "calculate">>
	<<set $categories.clothing.annualSpend = window.getAnnualSpend(_clothesTimePeriod, _clothesSpendPerPeriod) >> \
	<<set $categories.clothing.emissions = $categories.clothing.intensity * $categories.clothing.annualSpend>> \
	<<replace "#summary">>
		<if _clothesTimePeriod != $timePeriod.Annual>
		So that means your average annual spend on clothes is $categories.clothing.annualSpend.
		</if> \

		Your estimated yearly emmisions just for your wardrobe is <<= Math.floor($categories.clothing.emissions)>> Ktonnes CO2e.

		This figure would be less than estimated if you're buying your clothes secondhand.

Lets look into clothes!
Your wardrobe actually has a fair carbon impact.

How often do you buy new clothing?
<<listbox "_clothesTimePeriod" autoselect>>
	<<optionsfrom $timePeriod>>
<</listbox>>

How much do you spend on average when you buy new clothes? (in Â£)
<<numberbox "_clothesSpendPerPeriod" 40>>

<script>
	$categories.clothing.annualSpend = getAnnualSpend(_clothesTimePeriod, _clothesSpendPerPeriod);
</script>

<<if _clothesTimePeriod != $timePeriod.Annual>
So that means your average annual spend on clothes is $categories.clothing.annualSpend.
</if>>

Your estimated yearly emmisions just for your wardrobe is $categories.clothing.emissions() Ktonnes CO2e.

This figure would be less than estimated if you're buying your clothes secondhand.
